=============

This collection of files is property of Real Machines made by Erates.

You can use code that I wrote, but you have to let me know that you do. You can do this via IRC, Iâ€™m on #minecraftforge, #buildcraft and #ThermalExpansion on irc.esper.net
Or you can send me an email at reasno <at> hotmail <dot> com

You cannot compile this mod and distribute it.
